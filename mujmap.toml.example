## Required config

## Account username. Used for authentication to the server.

username = "example@fastmail.com"

## Shell command which will print a password or token to stdout for
## authentication. You service provider might call this an "app password" or
## "API token".

password_command = "pass example@fastmail.com"

## Fully qualified domain name of the JMAP service.
##
## mujmap looks up the JMAP SRV record for the domain part of the username to
## determine the JMAP session URL. Setting `fqdn` will cause it to use an
## alternate name for that lookup.  Mutually exclusive with `session_url`.

# fqdn = "fastmail.com"

## Session URL to connect to.
##
## Mutually exclusive with `fqdn`.

# session_url = "https://jmap.fastmail.com/.well-known/jmap

## Optional config

## Number of email files to download in parallel.
##
## This corresponds to the number of blocking OS threads that will be created for
## HTTP download requests. Increasing this number too high will likely result in
## many failed connections.

# concurrent_downloads = 8

## Number of seconds before timing out on a stalled connection.

# timeout = 5

## Number of retries to download an email file. 0 means infinite.

# retries = 5

## Whether to create new mailboxes automatically on the server from notmuch
## tags.

# auto_create_new_mailboxes = true

## If true, convert all DOS newlines in downloaded mail files to Unix newlines.

# convert_dos_to_unix = true

################################################################################
## Path config
##
## mujmap needs places to store email and bits of working state. These paths
## can all be specified in the config file, but most of the time you don't need to
## do this and it will choose reasonable defaults.
##
## mujmap has two "configuration modes" that inform how path defaults are chosen.
##
## In "directory mode", the --path option points to the directory containing
## mujmap.toml. In this mode, the default locations for mail and state files will
## be in subdirectories under this directory. This is the right mode to keep the
## entire mujmap data storage in a single place.
##
## In "file mode", the --path option points to a config file. In this mode, the
## default location for mail will be determined from notmuch's `mail_root` config
## variable, while the default location for state is operating-system specific.
## This mode is intended for tighter integration with notmuch "profiles".

## The cache directory in which to store mail files while they are being
## downloaded. It must be an absolute path. The default is operating-system
## specific.

# cache_dir =

## The location of the mail dir, where downloaded email is finally stored. It
## must be an absolute path. If not given in the config file, mujmap will choose
## an appropriate default for the configuration mode. You probably don't want to
## set this.

# mail_dir =

## The directory to store state files in. It must be an absolute path. If not
## given, mujmap will choose an appropriate default for the configuration mode.
## You probably don't want to set this.

# state_dir =

################################################################################
## Tag config
##
## Customize the names and synchronization behaviors of notmuch tags with JMAP
## keywords and mailboxes. You can most likely leave these alone if you prefer
## the notmuch defaults, unless you would like to specifically ignore a tag.
##
## mujmap exposes as much configurability as reasonable here. However, there are
## limitations with the non-configurable special tags built-in to notmuch. These
## include:
##
## - draft
## - flagged
## - passed
## - replied
## - unread
##
## These are still synchronized with the appropriate mailboxes and keywords, but
## cannot be configured like the rest of the options here.
##
## https://notmuchmail.org/special-tags/
##
## BEWARE of changing any of these settings *after* you already have a nice and
## happy notmuch instance up and running! If you want to make changes here, your
## best option is to perform the following steps:
##
## 1. Before changing to the new config, make sure you've committed all pending
## changes by running mujmap.
##
## 2. Move all mail from the maildir into the mujmap cache directory, which is
## in XDG_CACHE_DIR/mujmap on Linux, ~/Library/Caches/sh.eliza.mujmap on macOS,
## and %APPDATA%/mujmap/cache on Windows. Rename each file so that they follow
## the pattern !home!username!path!to!maildir!XXX.YYY, where each ! replaces the
## path separator of the original file location, and XXX and YYY are the mail
## and blob IDs. If you have notmuch configured to sync tags with maildir flags,
## be sure to remove the trailing ":2," and everything past it on each filename.
##
## 3. Because step 2 is annoying to do, you can just delete them and have mujmap
## redownload them later if you'd prefer.
##
## 4. Run `notmuch new --no-hooks` so that all of the messages you just removed
## are also removed from the database.
##
## 5. Delete the "mujmap.state.json" file in the maildir to force a full sync.
##
## 6. Change all the configuration options you'd like, then run mujmap. It
## should synchronize all the messages properly now.

[tags]

## Translate all mailboxes to lowercase names when mapping to notmuch tags.

# lowercase = false

## Directory separator for mapping notmuch tags to maildirs.

# directory_separator = "/"

## Tag for notmuch to use for messages stored in the mailbox labeled with the
## `Inbox` name attribute.
##
## If set to an empty string, this mailbox *and its child mailboxes* are not
## synchronized with a tag.

# inbox = "inbox"

## Tag for notmuch to use for messages stored in the mailbox labeled with the
## `Trash` name attribute.
##
## This configuration option is called `deleted` instead of `trash` because
## notmuch's UIs all prefer "deleted" by default.
##
## If set to an empty string, this mailbox *and its child mailboxes* are not
## synchronized with a tag.

# deleted = "deleted"

## Tag for notmuch to use for messages stored in the mailbox labeled with the
## `Sent` name attribute.
##
## If set to an empty string, this mailbox *and its child mailboxes* are not
## synchronized with a tag.

# sent = "sent"

## Tag for notmuch to use for messages stored in the mailbox labeled with the
## `Junk` name attribute and/or with the `$Junk` keyword, *except* for messages
## with the `$NotJunk` keyword.
##
## The combination of these three traits becomes a bit tangled, so further
## explanation is warranted. Most email services in the modern day, especially
## those that support JMAP, provide a dedicated "Spam" or "Junk" mailbox which
## has the `Junk` name attribute mentioned above. However, there may exist
## services which do not have this mailbox, but still support the `$Junk` and
## `$NotJunk` keywords. mujmap behaves in the following way:
##
## * If the mailbox exists, it becomes the sole source of truth. mujmap
##   will entirely disregard the `$Junk` and `$NotJunk` keywords.
## * If the mailbox does not exist, messages with the `$Junk` keyword *that
##   do not also have* a `$NotJunk` keyword are tagged as spam. When
##   pushing, both `$Junk` and `$NotJunk` are set appropriately.
##
## This configuration option is called `spam` instead of `junk` despite all of
## the aforementioned specifications preferring "junk" because notmuch's UIs all
## prefer "spam" by default.
##
## If set to an empty string, this mailbox, *its child mailboxes*, and these
## keywords are not synchronized with a tag.

# spam = "spam"

## Tag for notmuch to use for messages stored in the mailbox labeled with the
## `Important` name attribute and/or with the `$Important` keyword.
##
## * If a mailbox with the `Important` role exists, this is used as the
##   sole source of truth when pulling for tagging messages as "important".
## * If not, the `$Important` keyword is considered instead.
## * In both cases, the `$Important` keyword is set on the server when
##   pushing. In the first case, it's also copied to the `Important`
##   mailbox.
##
## If set to an empty string, this mailbox, *its child mailboxes*, and this
## keyword are not synchronized with a tag.

# important = "important"

## Tag for notmuch to use for the IANA `$Phishing` keyword.
##
## If set to an empty string, this keyword is not synchronized with a tag.

# phishing = "phishing"
